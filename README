pano
===

`pano' is an R package to convert between identifiers for UK parliamentary constituencies.

It now tries to handle constituency names. If you find a constituency
name which is not processed correctly, please let me know.

You can install pano using devtools:

    require(devtools)
    install_github("chrishanretty/pano")
